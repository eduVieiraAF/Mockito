Issues with unit tests after production code:

    → hard to deduce requirements;
    → intrinsic bias in testing of self-written;
    → Cannot know whether all requirements were tested

TDD:
    → All tests up-front:
        → create an empty class for SUT;
        → write all required tests:
            → you may expand SUT's public API to make tests compile;
            → you can't write internal implementation of SUT.
        → write internal implementation of SUT (after tests are written);
        → run tests;
        → debug until all tests pass.
