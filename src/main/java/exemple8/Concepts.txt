Objects vs Data Structures

Exposing behaviour and exposing data are 2 completely different responsibilities, therefore no class in the code base
should expose both.

In Java, both objects and data structures implicitly inherit from a class called Object.

Objects
    . Expose behaviour;
    . Should be injected into other objects;
    . Need to be unit tested explicitly;
    . Eligible to be substituted with test doubles.

Data Structures:
    . Expose data;
    . Should not have behaviour;
    . Can be instantiated by other objects and data structures;
    . Unit tests for objects will test data structures implicitly;
    . No need to substitute with test doubles.

"Mature programmers know that the idea that everything is an object is a myth"
    - Robert C. Martin, Clean Code.

"AAA" pattern:
    . Arrange
    . Act
    . Assert.
